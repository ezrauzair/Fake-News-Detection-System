📰 Fake News Detection System

This project leverages a fine-tuned BERT model to detect whether an article is fake or real. Trained on a popular fake news detection dataset, the system achieves an impressive accuracy of 97%. With a user-friendly interface, simply paste an article, and the model will determine its authenticity, providing insights with a pie chart showing the confidence of the classification.

📜 Features
* BERT-Based Fake News Detection: Uses a fine-tuned BERT model trained specifically to detect fake news with high precision.
* User-Friendly Input: Easily paste any article into the system to check its authenticity.
* Real-Time Classification: The system instantly provides results indicating whether the article is fake or real.
* Confidence Pie Chart: Visualizes how confident the model is in its decision, displaying a pie chart that shows the percentage of fake vs. real.

🚀 How It Works
* Input an article (or a portion of text).
* Submit the text for classification.
* The BERT model analyzes the content and predicts whether it's fake or real.
* The result is presented, along with a pie chart showing the confidence level for both "fake" and "real" labels.
